# Frontmatter Example Document

```toml
author = "https://fosstodon.org/@ecton"
last_updated_at = "2023-01-10 08:54:12-08:00" # date --rfc-3339=seconds
```

This is an example document with embedded frontmatter. The
pulldown-cmark-frontmatter crate removes the frontmatter code block so that it
does not show up in the final output.
